                Philiy's enthusiasm and knowledge about Scrum and Agile
                methodologies is striking. She takes it close to heart to help
                the team that is lucky enough to have her as a Scrum Master to
                succeed in its work through maintaining the Agile values and
                continuously adapting and learning. Her innovative techniques
                and creative ways of motivating people and rallying them behind
                a goal are contagious and result in improved team work and in
                the end better products.

                I consider myself very lucky to have had the opportunity to work
                with Philly. Both her and I worked together as part of a team
                that is the backbone back office system in the company, a team
                with great potential, but fragile motivation levels, a team that
                had been through a very rough time. Philly has been the catalyst
                of the teams success; she is very passionate yet humble, a true
                servant-leader.

                I’m terribly sad to see Philiy go, she is one of the best Scrum
                Masters I've ever had or hoped to have the pleasure to work
                with. Her infectious enthusiasm for SCRUM will eventually wear
                even the most determined doubters down. She took a team which
                was not co-located and with zero SCRUM experience and made them
                bond as a team and really *get* what the benefits of using SCRUM
                are. Any company will be lucky to work with her. I wouldn't
                hesitate to work with Philiy again, ever!
